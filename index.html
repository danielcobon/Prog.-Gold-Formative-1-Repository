        <p2>A study from NASA has found that the global sea level has raised by about 8 inches (20.32cm) since 1880.
          It has also been proposed that by 2100, another 1 to 8 feet increase of the water level will occur, which is the result of the melted land ice coupled with the increase in seawater as it warms.

        <h3>Factor in Global Warming</h3>

        <!--Description of the second column-->
        <p2>An article from the European Union states that one of the main factors that cause climate change is due to the increase in greenhouse gases.
          The gases that make up the greenhouse gases are carbon dioxide (CO2), methane, nitrous oxide and flourinated gases.
          The biggest percentage of the greenhouse gases is made up of carbon dioxide, which is created by human activity.
          While the others are produced by human activity as well in smaller percentages.
          It was noticed that the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmostsphere has increased by 48% in 2020 compared to the pre-industrial level (before 1750).

        <p2>A report from the World Health Organization (WHO) has stated that climate change could bring with it numerous health implications which could lead to illness or even death due the frequent extreme change in weather.
           With relation to this, of the 930 million people on this earth, around 12% of them use at least 10% of their earnings to sustain their health care, while the poorest are uninsured.
           Due to this, it leads to around 100 million people into poverty, with climate change worsening this trend.

        <p2>
          The above graph shows the the increase in carbon dioxide (CO2) in the earth's atmostsphere.  
          The data shown is taken at every 1st of November from 2000 to 2017,
          where 'Mean' is the average amount of CO2 (in mole fraction) in the earth's atmosphere 
          while 'Annual Increase' is the amount of increase of CO2 compared to the previous year.
          CO2 is one of the gases which makes up the greenhouse gases, 
          which in turn is also responsible for the increase in the earth's temperature, 
          leading to global warming.
